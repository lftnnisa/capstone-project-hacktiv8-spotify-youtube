- Loud and energetic tracks are trending on both platforms.
- Acoustic and instrumental songs tend to attract niche listeners and have lower popularity.
- YouTube-viral songs often have higher speechiness.

## 🤖 AI Support Explanation
- **LLM (Granite)** is used to analyze clustering summaries for insight generation.
- Tasks include: classification (popularity strength), platform tagging, key audio features detection.
- It supports summarizing patterns and forming recommendations based on clustering output.
